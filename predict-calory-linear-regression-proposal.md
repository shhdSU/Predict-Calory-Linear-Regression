## Introduction
Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle. Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. The goal of this project is to predict food calories based on their nutrients using Linear Regression as a part of machine learning.

## Data Description
We choose [Target](https://www.target.com/) and [Trader Joe's](https://www.traderjoes.com/home ) websites to scrape their nutrients’ data. Target is a general merchandise retailer with stores selling a wide variety of things, while Trader Joe’s is a national chain of neighborhood grocery stores, but our target is their own grocery online store websites. The features of our dataset include the following: **TOTAL_FAT**, **SATURATED_FAT**, **TRANS_FAT**, **CHOLESTEROL**, **SODIUM**, **TOTAL_CARBOHYDRATE**, **FIBER**, **TOTAL_SUGARS**, **PROTEIN**, **VITAMIN_D**, etc.. and our target is **CALORY**.

## Tools

Here the basic tools we will use in our project: <br/>
Technologies: python, and Jupyter Notebook with python libraries: 
- For EDA
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - seaborn
- For Web Scraping
  - BeatuifulSoup
  - Selenium
- For Linear Regression
  - statsmodels
  - scikit-learn


## Conclusion
We aim to improve the healthy life of people who cares and track their calories using Linear Regression algorithm to predict the food calories. By training and testing our model on the extracted data.
